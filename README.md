# react-intersectino-observer-example


[Code Sandbox here](https://rm638.sse.codesandbox.io/)

This is an example to show a target div intersecting with a sticky header.

The green div is the target. Scrolling past it into blue and going up is fine.
The issue is that scrolling into it doesn't update after it has intersected the viewport.
